#### purpose
****
DateQuest is a dating website with a focus on bringing users together through silly, adventurous, collaborative challenges throughout their date. Ask someone out, go on your date, and get a text message at the start of your date with three challenges to complete! 

#### overview
****
This is my final project for [General Assembly's Web Development Immersive](https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive), a 12 week programming intensive that takes people with no programming experience and turns them into full-stack web developers. 

There was a focus on BDD and testing for this project.
